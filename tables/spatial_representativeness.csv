0	Nil reason - None of the codes in the table is applicable in the context of the observed quantity or unknown, or not available information.
1	Microscale - An area or volume less than 100 m horizontal extent (for example, evaporation)
2	Toposcale, local scale - An area or volume of 100 m to 3 km horizontal extent (for example, air pollution, tornadoes)
3	Mesoscale - An area or volume of 3 km to 100 km horizontal extent (for example, thunderstorms, sea and mountain breezes)
4	Large scale- An area or volume of 100 km to 3000 km horizontal extent (for example, fronts, various cyclones, cloud clusters)
5	Planetary scale - An area or volume of more than 3000 km horizontal extent (for example, long upper tropospheric waves)
6	Drainage area - An area (also known as ‘catchment’) having a common outlet for its surface runoff, in km2
