8	8	Voice (ship). The observation is sent to a NMS through the telephone network. The communication may use Inmarsat, Iridium, Vsat, VHF
9	9	Email (ship). The observation is sent to a NMS through an email. The WMO message is attached to this email. The satellite communication provider may be Inmarsat, Iridium, Vsat
10	10	Web (ship). The observation is sent through the Web (example: TurboWeb). The satellite communication provider may be Inmarsat, Iridium, Vsat
11	11	Inmarsat-C (FM13, SAC41). Standard procedure used to report observations (FM13 messages) from conventional VOS for many years. Collect call system: the NMS which receives the observations pays the communication costs
12	12	Inmarsat-C (FM13, other SAC). FM13 messages are sent to a dedicated SAC (other than SAC41) established at one, or more LES. In general, communications are paid by the country who recruited the ship
13	13	Inmarsat-C (EUHC). Text messages containing compressed data (E-SURFMAR format) are sent ashore through Inmarsat-C to a dedicated SAC and LES. Communications are paid by the country who recruited the ship
14	14	Inmarsat-C (SEAS). SEAS binary messages sent through Inmarsat-C Data Mode to a dedicated SAC and LES. Communications are paid by NOAA/NWS
15	15	Automated Identification System (direct or through satellite)

18	18	Cellular (SMS). SMS sent through terrestrial wireless networks (GSM, GPRS)
19	19	Globalstar communication system
20	20	GMS (DCP). Data Collecting Platform of Geostationary Meteorological Satellites
21	21	Iridium (SBD). Short Burst Data service of Iridium communication system
22	22	Iridium (Email). Email sent through Iridium (e.g. Easymail)
23	23	Iridium (Dial-up). Dial-up communication using Iridium
24	24	Inmarsat-C (Data Mode). Data Mode service of Inmarsat-C used by S-AWS. See above for SEAS which also uses this service for conventional VOS
