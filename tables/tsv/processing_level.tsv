2	2	Level 0	Analogue/digital electric signals
3	3	Level I	Level I data (Primary Data): in general, are instrument readings expressed in appropriate physical units, and referred to Earth geographical coordinates. They require conversion to the normal meteorological variables (identified in Part I, Chapter 1). Level I data themselves are in many cases obtained from the processing of electrical signals such as voltages, referred to as raw data. Examples of these data are satellite radiances and water-vapour pressure, positions of constant-level balloons, etc. but not raw telemetry signals. Level I data still require conversion to the meteorological parameters specified in the data requirements.
4	4	Level II	Level II Data (Meteorological parameters). They may be obtained directly from many kinds of simple instruments, or derived from Level I data. For example, a sensor cannot measure visibility, which is a Level II quantity; instead, sensors measure the extinction coefficient, which is a Level I quantity.
5	5	Level III	Level III (Initial state parameters) are internally consistent data sets, generally in gridpoint form obtained from level II data by applying established initialization procedures. NOTE: Data exchanged internationally are level II or level III data.
6	6	Level IV	NA
