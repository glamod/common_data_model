Value	Description
0	Cellular (unspecified)
1	Meteosat DCP
2	Iridium (unspecified)
3	GOES DCP
4	VSAT (unspecified)
5	Landline telephone
6	Radio modem
7	E-mail (unspecified)
8	Voice (ship). The observation is sent to a NMS through the telephone network. The communication may use Inmarsat, Iridium, Vsat, VHF
9	Email (ship). The observation is sent to a NMS through an email. The WMO message is attached to this email. The satellite communication provider may be Inmarsat, Iridium, Vsat
10	Web (ship). The observation is sent through the Web (example: TurboWeb). The satellite communication provider may be Inmarsat, Iridium, Vsat
11	Inmarsat-C (FM13, SAC41). Standard procedure used to report observations (FM13 messages) from conventional VOS for many years. Collect call system: the NMS which receives the observations pays the communication costs
12	Inmarsat-C (FM13, other SAC). FM13 messages are sent to a dedicated SAC (other than SAC41) established at one, or more LES. In general, communications are paid by the country who recruited the ship
13	Inmarsat-C (EUHC). Text messages containing compressed data (E-SURFMAR format) are sent ashore through Inmarsat-C to a dedicated SAC and LES. Communications are paid by the country who recruited the ship
14	Inmarsat-C (SEAS). SEAS binary messages sent through Inmarsat-C Data Mode to a dedicated SAC and LES. Communications are paid by NOAA/NWS
15	Automated Identification System (direct or through satellite)
16	Argos system
17	Cellular (Dial-up). Dial-up communication using terrestrial wireless networks (GSM, GPRS)
18	Cellular (SMS). SMS sent through terrestrial wireless networks (GSM, GPRS)
19	Globalstar communication system
20	GMS (DCP). Data Collecting Platform of Geostationary Meteorological Satellites
21	Iridium (SBD). Short Burst Data service of Iridium communication system
22	Iridium (Email). Email sent through Iridium (e.g. Easymail)
23	Iridium (Dial-up). Dial-up communication using Iridium
24	Inmarsat-C (Data Mode). Data Mode service of Inmarsat-C used by S-AWS. See above for SEAS which also uses this service for conventional VOS
25	Inmarsat-C (Email). Email sent through Inmarsat-C
26	Orbcomm communication system
27	Vsat (Email). Email sent through Vsat
28	Vsat (Dial-up). Dial-up communication using Vsat
29	Delayed Mode only
30	Other (specify in footnote).
